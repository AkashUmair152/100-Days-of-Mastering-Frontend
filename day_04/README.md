## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/landing-page-mouthwash.git
cd landing-page-mouthwash
````

2. **Open `index.html` in a browser:**

You can use Live Server in VS Code or just open the file directly.

3. **(Optional)** Add your own images inside the `/assets` folder and update `data-img` paths in `index.html`.

---

## 📷 How It Works

* Each item has a `data-img` attribute with the image filename.
* On hover, JavaScript fetches that image and updates the background of a floating image box.
* GSAP animates the box’s appearance and its position, so it follows your cursor.
