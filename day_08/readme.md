# 🚀 Animated Navigation Menu with GSAP

A sleek, modern **slide-in navigation menu** built with **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** and clean HTML/CSS. This responsive navbar features smooth animations, backdrop blur effects, and intuitive open/close interactions — perfect for creative websites, portfolios, or landing pages.

---

## 🌟 Features

- ✅ **Hamburger-to-menu animation** using GSAP timeline
- ✅ **Slide-in sidebar** from the right (40% width)
- ✅ **Backdrop blur** (`backdrop-filter`) for modern glassmorphism effect
- ✅ **Staggered animation** for navigation links
- ✅ **Smooth open/close & reverse animation** with `timeline.reverse()`
- ✅ **Responsive design** with clean typography and icons (via [Remix Icons](https://remixicon.com))
- ✅ **Performance optimized** with `position: absolute` and minimal DOM

---

## 🎨 Demo (Conceptual)

> When the user clicks the **hamburger icon**:
> - The sidebar slides in from the right
> - Menu items (`Home`, `About`, etc.) fade in with a stagger
> - Close button appears and animates in
>
> On clicking **close**, the menu smoothly reverses the animation and hides.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure
- **CSS3** – Flexbox, positioning, backdrop blur, responsive layout
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Event listeners and DOM manipulation
- **GSAP 3** – High-performance animation timeline
- **Remix Icons CDN** – Clean, scalable SVG-like icons
- **No frameworks** – Lightweight and fast

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourname/gsap-navbar.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser:

   ```

3. Click the **☰ menu icon** to open the sidebar, and **✕** to close it.

> ✅ No build tools or server required — works offline.

## 💡 How It Works

### 1. **GSAP Timeline**

- `tl.play()` → opens the menu (`right: 0`)
- `tl.reverse()` → closes it smoothly
- Uses `stagger` for sequential link animation
- Paused by default (`tl.pause()`), waiting for user interaction

### 2. **Glassmorphism Effect**

```css
backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.432);
```

Creates a modern, translucent look — blends with the background image.

### 3. **Icons**

Uses [Remix Icons](https://remixicon.com) via CDN:
- `ri-menu-line` → hamburger
- `ri-close-line` → close button

---

## 🧩 Future Enhancements

- Add **mobile responsiveness** (collapse menu on small screens)
- Include **smooth scroll** to sections on link click
- Add **hover effects** on menu items
- Support **keyboard close** (Escape key)
- Add **overlay dim effect** on body when menu is open
- Integrate with **ScrollTrigger** for scroll-aware nav
