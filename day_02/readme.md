# Days 3 to 5 Progress

## Day 3: JavaScript Review & DOM Manipulation

- Reviewed JavaScript basics: variables, data types, functions.
- Practiced DOM manipulation: selecting elements, changing content/styles, adding event listeners.
- Added a simple interaction to the Day 1 page (e.g., a button that changes text color).

## Day 4: Tailwind CSS Review

- Studied Tailwind CSS utility classes and responsive prefixes.
- Learned how to customize `tailwind.config.js`.
- Rebuilt the layout and styling from Day 1/2 using Tailwind classes instead of custom CSS.

## Day 5: Challenge Planning

- Decided on a naming convention: `day-01-project-name`.
- Established a consistent structure for daily project folders.
- Planned how to share progress on LinkedIn (screenshots, short videos, code snippets).
